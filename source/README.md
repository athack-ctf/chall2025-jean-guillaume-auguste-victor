# Running This Challenge

- Compile with `make`, then you can do a quick test of the challenge.
- On one terminal, start `./main`
- On another, do `netcat 0.0.0.0 2025`, then type random stuff --> access denied. Type `At_u5C!` for access.

- Then move the `main` program to the `offline-artifacts` directory; this should be given to participants as well for RE.

- To Dockerize: `docker build .`
